# Lead-Scoring-Data-Analysis
#### Build a model to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

### Introduction :
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

The company markets its courses on various websites and search engines such as Google. Once these people access the website, they can browse the courses, fill out a course form, or watch videos. When these people fill out a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified as leads. In addition, the company also obtains leads through previous referrals. Once these leads are captured, sales team employees start making calls, writing emails, and more.Through this process, some of the leads are converted while most are not. The typical lead conversion rate in X Education is around 30%.

Now, although X Education is getting a lot of leads, it has a very low lead conversion rate. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them convert. To make this process more efficient, the company wants to identify the most potential leads, also called “Hot Leads”. If they are successful in identifying this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should increase as the sales team will focus more on communicating with potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

There are many leads produced in the first stage (top), but only a handful of them become paying clients in the second stage (bottom). In order to obtain a better lead conversion, you need to nurture the potential leads properly in the intermediate stage (e.g., educating the leads about the product, communicating frequently, etc.).

X Education wishes to choose the most promising leaders, that is to say leader, who are probably transformed into payment of the clientele. The Company requires you to build a model where you need to assign a note on leaders on each leaders, such as customers with higher main indicator H, have a higher conversion chance and customers with a level of higher foreground evaluation have a lower conversion chance.

### Problem Statement :
 * X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
 * The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.
 * The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Objective:
 * Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
 * A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
